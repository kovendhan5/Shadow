- `analyze_user_sentiment(message)`: Emotion detection
- `update_emotional_state()`: AI emotion adjustment
- `get_emotional_state_description()`: Current state summary
- `get_conversation_summary()`: Analytics and statistics

## üé≠ Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation

```python
from brain.orpheus_ai import chat_with_orpheus

# Simple emotional conversation
response = chat_with_orpheus("I'm feeling really excited about my new job!")
print(response)  # Orpheus will respond with matching excitement
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from brain.orpheus_ai import EmotionalAI

ai = EmotionalAI()
# Get current emotional state
state = ai.get_emotional_state_description()
print(f"Orpheus is: {state}")

# Have a conversation
response = ai.generate_emotional_response("I'm worried about tomorrow")
print(f"Orpheus: {response}")

# Check new emotional state
new_state = ai.get_emotional_state_description()
print(f"Orpheus is now: {new_state}")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. API Key Not Configured

**Error**: "Gemini API key not configured"
**Solution**: Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` file

#### 2. Import Errors

**Error**: "Module not found"
**Solution**: Ensure all required packages are installed:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv
```

#### 3. GUI Not Opening

**Error**: GUI window doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check tkinter installation and try:

```bash
python -m tkinter
```

#### 4. Emotional Responses Not Working

**Error**: Generic responses without emotion
**Solution**: Verify API key is valid and has quota remaining
