Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative field of computer science that enables machines to mimic human intelligence. This includes learning from data, reasoning through problems, and understanding language. AI is broadly categorized into Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks and is the only type of AI that currently exists, and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a theoretical future AI with human-like cognitive abilities. From virtual assistants and recommendation engines to self-driving cars, AI is already deeply integrated into our daily lives, and its impact is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years.
