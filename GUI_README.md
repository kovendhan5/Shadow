## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**GUI doesn't start:**

- Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Install required packages: `pip install tkinter`
- Check that all Shadow AI modules are in the same directory

**Voice input not working:**

- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Install speech recognition: `pip install speechrecognition pyaudio`
- Check microphone is working in other applications

**Tasks not executing:**

- Verify .env file exists with API keys
- Check internet connection for AI processing
- Look at the activity log for specific error messages

**Import errors:**

- The GUI has fallback mode if Shadow AI modules aren't available
- Install missing dependencies shown in error messages
- Ensure all files are in the correct directory structure

## Architecture

### Files

- `gui_modern.py` - Main GUI application with animations
- `launch_gui.py` - Launcher with dependency checking
- `demo_gui.py` - Demo version for testing
- `launch_gui.bat` - Windows batch launcher

### Dependencies

- **Required**: `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- **Optional**: `speechrecognition`, `pyaudio`, `pyttsx3` (for voice)
- **Shadow AI**: Universal processor and executor modules

### Thread Safety

- Background processing prevents GUI freezing
- Queue-based communication between threads
- Safe UI updates using `root.after()`

## Customization

### Colors

Edit the `colors` dictionary in `ModernShadowGUI.__init__()`:

```python
self.colors = {
    'bg_primary': '#1a1a1a',    # Main background
    'accent': '#00d4aa',        # Accent color
    'text_primary': '#ffffff',  # Main text
    # ... more colors
}
```

### Animations

Adjust animation speeds in the `animate_*` methods:

- `animate_pulse()` - Status indicator pulse speed
- `animate_typing()` - Typing dots speed
- `animate_progress()` - Progress bar update rate
